# Patterns

A collection of reusable Ruby objects for Rails applications.
* Service object module (to be used as a mixin)
* ApiRequest class to wrap HTTP requests (matches interface of Unirest)
* Notifier class (for reporting to bug tracking services, matches interface of Rollbar)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "patterns", :git => "https://github.com/davev/patterns.git"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install patterns

## Usage

#### Service Mixin
1. set up a service object class and include the Service mixin.  the return value of the call method will be accessible through the result attribute.  see source for advanced usage.

```ruby
  class GreetWorld
    include Patterns::Service

    def initialize(msg)
      @msg = msg
    end

    def call
      return @msg
    end
  end
```

2. invoke service class (mixin provides nice syntax for invocation)
```ruby
  res = GreetWorld.call("hello")
```

3. mixin provides common interface for retrieving result, status, and error.
```ruby
  res.result
  # => "hello"

  res.success?
  # => true

  res.error
  # => nil

  # if an error occurred while executing service code:
  res.error
  # => "the stack overflowed"
```

#### ApiRequest Class
ApiRequest api matches the [Unirest](http://unirest.io/ruby.html) interface.  see source for advanced usage.

```ruby
  response = Patterns::ApiRequest.get(
    endpoint_url,
    params: {
      client_id: @client.id
    }
  )

  response.body if response.success?
```

#### Notifier Class
Notifier api matches the [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/docs/notifier/rollbar-gem/) interface.  Assumes the pertinent ENV vars are set with credentials for the notifier service being used, e.g. Rollbar.
```ruby
  begin
    # do stuff
  rescue => e
    Notifier.error(e, e.message, client_id: @client.id)
  end
```



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
