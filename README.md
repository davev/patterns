# Patterns

A collection of reusable Ruby objects for Rails applications.
* Service object module (to be used as a mixin)
* ApiRequest class (matches interface of Unirest)
* Notifier class (for reporting to bug tracking services, matches interface of Rollbar)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
